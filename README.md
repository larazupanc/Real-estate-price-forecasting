# Real-estate-price-forecasting
In this project, multiple regression and tree-based models are applied to predict house prices. The approach starts with classical linear methods and continues with ensemble models. Random Forest is used as a baseline, followed by a Gradient Boosted Trees model with engineered features to better capture non-linear relationships in the data.
